About This Landing page:
I have used technologies like : Reactjs, Context API, Css, Php, and Rest API.

n this landing page, I have displayed data regarding SpaceX capsules. It features a nice and clean interface composed of three sections: the top banner, the middle filter search section, and the bottom grid section where capsule data is displayed.

ReactJs,Contex API, Rest API and CSS: is used for the frontend to intreact with the Api to fetch data from the SpaceX API.
PHP: it's is used for the authorization REST API.
